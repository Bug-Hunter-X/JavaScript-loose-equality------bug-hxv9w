This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript programming involving type coercion and loose equality. The `foo` function aims to handle null values gracefully, but a subtle mistake in its comparison logic leads to unexpected behavior in certain cases. The solution showcases the use of strict equality (===) to address the issue, ensuring accurate null checks.
